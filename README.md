## Description

The Library Management API is a backend application built using NestJS and MongoDB. This API provides a robust solution for managing a library system, allowing users to perform CRUD operations efficiently. It supports the following features:

Add New Books: Users can add new books to the library database with important details such as Title, Author, Genre, Published Year, ISBN (unique), and Stock Count.

Update Existing Books: Users can update book information with real-time validation checks, including ISBN uniqueness checks to avoid duplicates.

Search Books: Provides functionality to search for books using keywords with a fuzzy search feature to enhance the search accuracy, even for partial matches.

Retrieve Books: Users can fetch a list of all books or specific books from the library with detailed information.

CRUD Operations: All Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations are supported securely and efficiently to manage the library's resources.
.

## Key Features

MongoDB Database: Persistent storage using MongoDB for storing book information.

ISBN Uniqueness Validation: Ensures that each book in the system has a unique ISBN number for precise identification.

Fuzzy Search: Allows users to search for books using keywords, providing flexibility in locating books even if exact matches are unavailable.

NestJS Backend: Scalable and modular architecture built with NestJS to handle requests and execute business logic.

RESTful API: Exposes endpoints that allow interaction with the system over HTTP using standard REST principles.

SwaggerUI: Provides an interactive API documentation platform, making it easier for developers and users to explore and test endpoints.


## Tech Stack

Backend: NestJS (Node.js framework)
Database: MongoDB
Libraries: Mongoose (ODM for MongoDB)
Fuzzy Search: Integrated for improved search results
TypeScript: For strongly-typed JavaScript development
SwaggerUI: For User-Friendly Documentation and Interactive
PostmanAPI: For API testing


## Endpoints

POST /books: Add a new book to the library.
GET /books: Get all books or search for books using a query parameter.
GET /books/:id: Get a specific book by its ID.
PUT /books/:id: Update a book's details by ID.
DELETE /books/:id: Remove a book from the library by ID.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
